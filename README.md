This service allows you to launch on the computer of the desired person a small software very economical in resources that will give you access to a website.
You can send text messages via the website.

Once your message is sent, the computer will receive it and a voice will read the message on the computer's current audio device so that your message can be heard by the recipient under any circumstances.

This allows for example to pass instructions between 2 people who are too far away in the house to communicate without moving.

Moreover, if the recipient is listening to music and that affects his perception of surrounding sounds like your voice, the fact that the robotic voice reads your message sent with the website guarantees that the recipient will have received your message even while listening to music at the same time.

The website is available on all platforms! You can access it from another computer, a tablet and even your smartphone! Nice not.

**-> For security reasons, you must be on the same internet network as the server running on the computer to access the website.**
